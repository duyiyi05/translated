# 03 — Style Selection Guide (Faithful / Fluid / Creative)

## Why style selection matters
Different content types need different translation latitude. Style should be selected deliberately, not implicitly.

## Style modes

### Faithful
Best for legal, security, compliance, contracts.
- Priority: semantic precision.
- Risk if misused: awkward phrasing but acceptable.
- Failure mode to avoid: meaning shift.

### Fluid
Best for product UX, support center, release notes.
- Priority: clarity + natural readability.
- Risk if misused: minor lexical drift.
- Failure mode to avoid: inconsistency with product terminology.

### Creative
Best for campaigns, headlines, thought leadership.
- Priority: persuasion and local resonance.
- Risk if misused: tone divergence from brand.
- Failure mode to avoid: unsupported claims or legal overreach.

## Mapping matrix

| Content Type | Recommended Style | Approval Gate | Main Risk |
|---|---|---|---|
| Terms & Policies | Faithful | Legal owner | Legal meaning drift |
| UI Strings | Fluid | PM + Linguist | Terminology mismatch |
| Help Center | Fluid | Language lead | Readability decline |
| Email Campaigns | Creative | Marketing owner | Brand tone variance |
| Press/PR copy | Creative | Comms owner | Claims inconsistency |

## EN→IT notes
- Fluid mode should respect selected formality convention.
- Creative mode requires explicit agreement on anglicism tolerance.

## EN→TR notes
- Fluid mode should privilege natural Turkish cadence.
- Creative mode must preserve trust and avoid exaggerated claims.

## Operational control
Style selection is a required field in intake metadata and is reviewed during QA sampling.
