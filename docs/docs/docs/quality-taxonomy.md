## Quality Philosophy

Quality is measurable.  
Errors are categorized, weighted, and converted into preventive improvements.

AI outputs are treated as drafts.  
Human validation remains mandatory.

## Error Categories

| Category | Example | Severity |
|----------|----------|----------|
| Critical | Legal misinterpretation | 5 |
| Major | Terminology inconsistency | 3 |
| Major | Incorrect register (Lei vs tu) | 3 |
| Minor | Punctuation / style | 1 |
| Minor | Formatting deviation | 1 |

## Scoring Model

Weighted Score =  
(5 × Critical) + (3 × Major) + (1 × Minor)

Pass Threshold: ≥ 95%

4. Vendor calibration feedback
5. Track improvement trend
